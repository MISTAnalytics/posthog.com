Most people think becoming a 10x engineer means improving their typing speed, buying more monitors, or using the latest framework where everything is a macro. These hacks might speed up the time from an idea to a rolled-out implementation, but you'll get a 1.5x boost at most.

So, where does the next 8.5x come from? By zooming out and solving for user impact. You, as an engineer, need to deeply understand (and care) about your users. In doing so, you'll generate true leverage by choosing the right problem, building the right solution, and solving their "hair-on-fire" problems. The best way to do this? Speak directly to them.

## Tickets are highly lossy

Your users are real people. They have problems to overcome. They work in a team. They have hopes and dreams. But if the only information that you get is the ticket "Add a button to this page" you miss all that context. And you miss the opportunity to build a significantly better product.

Let's discuss an example from PostHog: we were getting requests from users for a better "person" page - showing the events for that user in a timeline.

Karl, an engineer on the team, could have put the events in a simple timeline and called it done. But decided to dig deeper and speak to our users. Why did they want the timeline? What was the problem that they were trying to solve?

He learned that there were two main use cases: First, understanding how individual users are interacting with the product at key stages ‚Äî like using a new feature. Second, for debugging. Users would get a support request from a user and want to know what they did that caused the bug. He realized it's almost impossible to understand what the user did well enough to reproduce it from the event list alone.

Karl had used session recording products before. Recordings are much better for understanding individual user behavior and debugging, but with the existing tools it was almost impossible to find sessions with specific behavior. Because he knew our system architecture he realized you could filter the recordings by the product analytics data. Enabling you to go from high-level trends to viewing the exact sessions that caused them.

One hackathon later, we had a prototype. Session recording is now a core part of our product and was a key driver in our strategy shift from a product analytics tool to a product operating-system.

### Solving the information bottleneck: direct user-engineering interaction

In traditional tech companies, information flows from the user to the product manager (PM) by an interview, and then from the PM to the engineer through a bunch of tickets:

![PM to engineer](../images/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews/pm-to-engineer.png)

At each stage, important context is lost. Information flows one way, so you can‚Äôt go deeper on the important areas, and engineers lose agency in what they're building and why. In such an environment, speed is the only logical optimization.

Here's what it looks like when engineers talk directly to users:

![Direct user-Engineer Interaction](../images/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews/direct-interaction.png)

Information moves quickly and in both directions, boosting the signal. By increasing the signal you can quickly cut scope, realize you‚Äôre tackling the wrong problem, or come up with a more elegant solution ‚Äì something engineers can do most effectively because they have the background on the existing architecture and components. 

Companies still need product managers (I'm the Head of Product at PostHog after all üòÖ), but we ship faster and better because our engineers are actively speaking to users. And because our product managers aren't spending all their time on tickets, they have time to surface new opportunities or build out [our bigger vision](/blog/helping-engineers-to-product).

## Booking user interviews: Defining segments and automating the process

To build with users, it‚Äôs crucial to develop a system to quickly speak with customers. If the friction is too high, you‚Äôll ride an initial burst of motivation followed by regression to the old way of heads-down coding.

The first step to speaking to your users is to find them. You can define your segment using company traits, user traits, and behavioral information. A data warehouse or a product analytics tool like PostHog can be helpful here.

Then you need to can contact them and book a time. The simplest way is to email out a Calendly link in batches via bcc‚Äôed. But quickly you should move to an in-app prompt. We‚Äôve seen an increase in conversion from outreach to booking by ~5x (from 3% to 16%), a reduction in email spam, and more fine-grained control of the number of bookings a week. A reward like a $30 merchandise voucher helps.

## Types of user interviews: problem exploration and solution exploration

To get the most out of the interview, you should know the goal. The goal normally fits into two buckets:

### 1. Problem exploration

Find the biggest hair-on-fire problem and then deeply understand the parameters. Focus on the concrete times they‚Äôve experienced the problem.

Example questions:
- How have they tried to solve it before?
- What do they think of the other solutions on the market?
- Would they pay for it?
- Can you talk me through the last time you experienced this problem?
- Is this actually a problem for you?

**Recommendation:** Read "The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick. It's a fantastic primer on problem exploration.

### 2. Solution validation

You‚Äôve identified the hair-on-fire problem and understand it well. Now you‚Äôre validating whether your solution actually solves it. Focus on presenting the user with quick prototypes.

Example activities:
 - Have the user click through a Figma prototype and think out-loud. Ask them to complete the high-level goal and see where they get stuck. Ask what they think the text means.

- Send a few mockups of the solutions over Slack to the user from the problem exploration interview and ask if it solves the problem.

- Create a mock-up and have a call with the user to see if they will commit to paying some amount if you build it.

**Recommendation:** The book "Don‚Äôt make me think" is great for usability testing.

## Build a quick feedback loop by combining sync and async communication

User interviews are high-bandwidth: you can quickly narrow down the most important problem and gather all the parameters. But it normally takes a few days to get on the call.

After the initial discussion, get your user on Slack for B2B or iMessage for B2C. This will enable you to quickly follow up with mockups or further questions during the solution validation phase.

Check out this example from Li when building out our feature flag permissions. She received the response 3 minutes (!!) later.

![Slack feedback on feature flags](../images/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews/feature-flags-feedback.png)

The more important the problem for the user, the quicker they'll respond.

## Beware solution ideas from users, reframe them as problems

During interviews, users will often suggest an idea for the solution of what they want. It‚Äôs crucial to not accept this at face value and instead ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù until you can reframe it as a problem with the appropriate context. 

Often the solution they propose doesn‚Äôt actually solve the problem they experienced, or there‚Äôs a much better solution that you can build instead. But most times it's not even a problem they are facing at all! Treat the solution idea as an ember and get curious about it.

*There's an entire [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) dedicated to this.*

## Sometimes it's better to just ship what the user is asking for

But be careful not to go too far the other way and generalize every problem. The art of product is using your judgment.

![XKCD: The general problem](../images/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews/the-general-problem.png)

Particularly for small usability improvements or where you already have a strong thesis it's better to move faster. It's a great way to build a better product, drive word-of-mouth growth and encourage more relevant feedback.

Here's an email Paul sent 3 hours after a customer interview with 3 PRs shipped to production.

## The challenge: Book a user interview this week

Across PostHog‚Äôs engineering teams we see the benefits of engineers speaking directly to users: more important problems being solved and better products being shipped. But chances are you won‚Äôt actually believe me until you‚Äôve done a few interviews yourself and realized what someone wrote on a ticket is completely different from reality.

So here‚Äôs the challenge: **book your first user interview this week next time you‚Äôre on the computer**. *Add a reminder on your phone now*

It will take less than 15 minutes to set up. How? Create a Calendly link and connect it to your Google Meet and Google Calendar. Grab a list of 30-50 customer emails and send out the following message via bcc:

```jsx
Hi! I‚Äôm X, a software engineer at Y. I‚Äôm currently working on Z and would love your input on it. Free for a quick call at any of these times? {INSERT CALENDLY LINK} 
```

Or if there‚Äôs already a sales call or customer interview organized then ask to join and add your own questions at the end.
