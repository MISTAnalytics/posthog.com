Once your PostHog instance is up and running, the next step is to start sending events.

PostHog enables you to analyze data in real-time, as events come in. Make full use of this power by ingesting live data with our analytics integrations: [client libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#client-libraries), [server libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#server-libraries), as well as [third-party platforms](/docs/integrate/overview#integrations).

The purpose of this guide is to help you understand some key concepts with a goal of ingesting live data into PostHog. For simplicity, we'll focus on _client_ libraries as a means of data ingestion.

The guide covers the following:

-   [How autocapture works with the JavaScript library](#use-autocapture)
-   [How to capture user events with PostHog](#capture-user-events)

If you prefer to learn by doing, you can get started on the web with the [JavaScript snippet](/docs/integrate/client/snippet-installation).

> Note that some events with a never-before-seen distinct ID are deliberately delayed by around a minute.
> [More on that in the "Event ingestion nuances" section.](#event-ingestion-nuances)

## Use autocapture

import JSAutoCapture from '../integrate/client/js/snippets/autocapture.mdx'
import JSCaptureIgnoreElements from '../integrate/client/js/snippets/capture-ignore-elements.mdx'

> Autocapture is presently only available in the web browser using the JavaScript library. For non-browser platforms and for situations where you wish to manually capture events, see the [capture user events](#capture-user-events) section.

<JSAutoCapture />
<JSCaptureIgnoreElements />

## Capture user events

This allows you to send more context than the default event info that PostHog captures whenever a user does something. In that case, you can send an event with any metadata you may wish to add.

<MultiLanguage selector="tabs">

```js
posthog.capture('[event-name]', { property1: 'value', property2: 'another value' })
```

```android
PostHog.with(this)
       .capture("Button B Clicked", new Properties()
                                        .putValue("color", "blue")
                                        .putValue("icon", "new2-final"));
```

```ios
// In swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"])

// In objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++" }];
```

```react-native
posthog.capture('Button B Clicked', {
    color: "blue",
    icon: "new2-final"
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

A `capture` call requires:

-   `event` to specify the event name
    -   We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

-   `properties`, which is an object with any information you'd like to add
